# Setting Up Your Computer

Before we do any coding in Java, we will have to download some important stuff. 
[Here is where you can download Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
Follow the instructions listed and get the Java Runtime Environment or JRE downloaded.

Next, I like to code in a code editor called Eclipse and you can download that [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
